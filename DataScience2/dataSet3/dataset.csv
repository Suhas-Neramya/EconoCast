"Bans and price caps targeting Russian oil are having the “intended effect” despite surprisingly resilient production and exports in recent months, according to Toril Bosoni from the International Energy Agency.The European Union’s embargo on Russian oil products came into effect on Feb. 5, building on the $60 oil price cap implemented by the G-7 (Group of Seven) major economies on Dec. 5.Bosoni, who’s head of the oil industry and markets division at the IEA, told CNBC on Wednesday that Russian oil production and exports had held up “much better than expected” in recent months. This is because Moscow has been able to reroute much of the crude that previously went to Europe to new markets in Asia.China, India and Turkey in particular ramped up purchases to partially offset the 400,000-barrel-per-day fall in Russian crude exports to Europe in January, according to the IEA’s oil market report published Wednesday. Some Russian oil is also still making its way to Europe through the Druzhba pipeline and Bulgaria, both of which are exempt from EU embargo.As such, Russian net oil output fell by only 160,000 barrels a day from pre-war levels in January, with 8.2 million barrels of oil shipped to markets worldwide, the IEA said. The agency added that G-7 price caps may also be helping to bolster Russian exports to some extent, as Moscow is forced to sell its Urals oil at a lower price to those countries complying with the caps, which potentially makes it more attractive than other sources of crude.Despite Russia’s substantial export volumes, Bosoni argued that this did not mean the sanctions had failed.“The price cap was put in place to allow for Russian oil to continue to flow to market, but at the same time reducing Russian revenues. Even though Russian production is coming to market, we’re seeing that the revenues that Russia receives from its oil and gas have really come down,” Bosoni said.“For instance in January, export revenues for Russia were about $13 billion, that’s down 36% from a year ago,” she said. “Russian fiscal receipts from the oil industry is down 48% in the year, so in that sense we can say that the price cap is having its intended effect.”She also highlighted the growing discrepancy between Russian Urals crude prices and international benchmark Brent crude. The former averaged $49.48 per barrel in January, according to the Russian Finance Ministry, while Brent was trading above $85 a barrel on Thursday.Importantly, Russia’s 2023 budget is based on a Urals price average of $70.10/bbl, so plunging fiscal revenues from oil operations year-on-year are leaving a substantial hole in public finances.Bosoni also noted that the indications are that Moscow may not be able to reallocate the trade of oil products in the same way as it has crude exports, which is why the IEA expects exports and production to fall further in the coming months.“We’re seeing now some reallocation of trade of the products but we haven’t seen the same shift as we saw for crude, which is why we’re expecting Russian exports to fall and production to fall,” she said.Production cutRussia announced last week that it would cut production by 500,000 barrels a day in March in response to the latest round of Western bans, amounting to around 5% of its latest crude output.However, Bosoni said this was in line with the IEA’s expectations.“This is included in our balances that still see the markets relatively well supplied through the first half of the year, so we’re not too concerned about this decline, we think there’s enough supply to meet demand for the coming months,” she said.“The question will be when summer comes around, refinery activity picks up to meet summer driving and China rebound really takes off, this is when we can see the market tighten really through the rest of the year.”In its report, the IEA suggested the production cut may be less about retaliation and more an attempt by Moscow to shore up pricing by curbing output rather than continuing to sell at a large discount to countries complying with the G-7 price caps.Global oil demandGlobal oil demand growth is expected to pick up in 2023 after a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2022, with China accounting for a substantial portion of the projected increase.The IEA said a pronounced uptick in air traffic in recent weeks highlighted the central role of jet fuel deliveries in 2023 growth. Oil deliveries are expected to surge by 1.1 million barrels a day to hit 7.2 million barrels a day over the course of 2023, with total demand hitting a record 101.9 million barrels a day.The effects of the West’s latest oil embargo and price cap will be a key factor in meeting that demand growth, the IEA report noted.“So will Beijing’s stance on domestic refinery activity and product exports amid its reopening. New refineries in Africa and the Middle East as well as China are expected to step in to cater for the growth in refined product demand,” it said.“If the price cap on products is half as successful as the crude cap, product markets may well weather the storm – but more crude supplies would be required to prevent renewed stock draws later in the year.”

"The energy transition will require oil and gas for decades to come, but the supply of lower-cost, lower-carbon “advantaged” barrels remain scarce, threatening emissions targets and causing upstream providers to pivot to new strategies, according to “Scraping the Barrel” a new Horizons analysis from Wood Mackenzie.Wood Mackenzie’s analysis concludes that in terms of overall supply, total discovered and prospective oil and gas resources are more than double projected demand in 2050. However, truly advantaged resources, with low breakeven (resilience to low prices) and emissions (sustainability in scope 1 and 2 terms) are anything but plentiful. Most developed fields have little to offer and only 28% of the resources in commercial undeveloped fields, roughly 49 billion barrels of equivalent (boe), are advantaged in terms of breakeven below US$30 Brent with emissions intensity of less than 20 kgCO2e/boe.“We see enough advantaged resources to satisfy only about half of our base-case oil and gas demand forecast to 2050,” said Andrew Latham, vice president, Energy Research for Wood Mackenzie Upstream. “Even our much lower AET-1.5 demand scenario – which lays out what is needed to achieve the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement by keeping emissions within 1.5 °C of pre-industrial levels and reaching global net zero by 2050 – will require some disadvantaged supply.”Under Wood Mackenzie’s base Energy Transition Outlook (ETO), oil demand peaks in 2030, before declining slowly to 94 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2050. The AET 1.5 requires 20 million b/d lower than the ETO by 2035, but will still be 33 million b/d by 2050. Under the ETO scenario, gas demand will be 88 million boe/d in 2050, some 12% higher than today. Under the AET-1.5 scenario, gas demand in 2050 will fall to 59 million boe/d.New exploration, decarbonization technologies and biofuels deliver some reliefWith few advantaged resources in brownfields and undeveloped fields, exploration could play a key role in locating and increasing this supply.The industry discovered 228 billion boe in new fields between 2012 and 2021, with an average emissions intensity of 16 kgCO2e/boe, versus the current global average of 23 kgCO2e/boe (19 kgCO2e/boe for undeveloped fields). And with a weighted average cost of supply in Brent price terms of just US$33/bbl.Latham added, “We expect high-impact exploration to be an important source of new resource for as long as demand remains at or near our ETO trajectory. Recent results suggest a contribution of around 5-10 billion boe of new advantaged barrels a year. Most will be found within energy super basins. Exploration on this scale over the next two decades will add oil and gas supply of around 10-15 million boe a day by 2050.”Decarbonization technologies and biofuels could play an even bigger role. Bio-based diesel and aviation fuels from plant-based feedstock could emit 80% less carbon than the crude oil-based products that dominate today’s oil market. Wood Mackenzie projects up to 20 million b/d being possible by 2050.“This is really a wake-up call for the industry and for the overall energy transition outlook,” said Latham. “These are avenues that help alleviate advantaged supply pressures, but it is definitely going to be an uphill struggle.”A difficult road ahead for upstream sectorWhile these strategies may help, it will become much more difficult for companies to find and produce the advantaged barrels needed to meet base ETO demand.Latham concludes that it would be very difficult for advantaged resources alone to meet all ETO oil and gas demand: “We are entering an interesting period in the upstream industry. Some companies will double down and hope for less competition in the sector. However, many may begin or accelerate their exit from the sector to pursue low-carbon energies and renewables. If this is the case, security of supply may become threatened, and, unfortunately, we may see companies turning to disadvantaged resources to meet demand.”

"Domestic Gas Resources Can Improve the Lives of Africa’s Young, Increasing Population, and Deliver the Energy it Needs to Develop within a Just Energy Transition.The International Gas Union (IGU) in partnership with Hawilti Ltd. released an important new study on Gas for Africa, assessing the potential for domestic gas resources to energise Africa in line with the global energy transition. The African Energy Commission (AU-AFREC) and the Africa Finance Corporation endorse the report and its findings.Africa has the lowest energy per capita in the world, while the average electricity use of a sub-Saharan Africa resident is lower than that of a household fridge in the US.Where energy is available in African countries, it is often expensive, inefficient, polluting, and unreliable: for example, Nigeria’s grid collapsed four times between January and September 2022.Domestic natural gas can help to alleviate Africa’s energy poverty, but despite producing over 6% of the world’s natural gas supply and having close to one tenth of proven global reserves, most of the African continent has no access to its natural gas. Africa’s domestic gas markets remain under-developed or non-existent, especially south of the Sahara, and much of Africa’s abundant natural gas resource development has been for export to the rest of the world. Africa produces over 280 bcm of natural gas, while its domestic demand is just above 160 bcm.The adoption of natural gas in Africa will have minimal impact on the net global GHG emissions, given its miniscule starting point.Africa has a fifth of the world’s population and represents only 3% of global emissions. For the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries, without South Africa, the estimated share of emissions is 0.55%. If Africa consumes 50% (90 bcm/y) more natural gas by 2030 than it does today, it would generate cumulative CO2 emissions of 10 gigatons (Gt), taking its share of global emissions to 3.5% by 2050, according to the IEA.In the short-term, natural gas can also provide an immediate emissions reductions benefit when it replaces higher emitting energy sources, such as biomass, wood, charcoal, coal, and heavy fuel oil. For example, when replacing coal with natural gas in power generation, Africa can achieve a reduction of 50% in greenhouse gas (GHG) and more than 90% in air pollution emissions.To stay on a long-term decarbonisation trajectory, developing gas infrastructure and markets in Africa should also go hand in hand with integration of variable renewable generation, carbon capture, renewable gases, and hydrogen.Africa wants to leverage its 18 trillion cubic metres of natural gas to rebalance pressing needs of local development with lucrative export revenues.Access to gas can provide stable electricity in countries with no lower-emission alternatives and strengthen power systems to add more renewable energy, and begin decarbonising energy supply, displacing wood, biomass, charcoal, and diesel. Developing domestic access to gas in Africa can provide energy needed today, while anchoring the continent’s future low- carbon and renewable energy.By developing domestic gas markets and re-orienting gas towards its own energy needs Africa seeks to promote industrialisation, create jobs, diversify economies, produce fertilizer to grow food, petrochemicals to make consumer goods and advanced products, and steel and cement to develop modern infrastructure.To realise its vast potential and benefit from lucrative sector investments, a pragmatic approach, sense of urgency, and focus on competitiveness are required for Africa to attract the billions of dollars that will be injected into gas projects this decade.Sustainability improvements in current operations will be vital for the gas value chain in Africa to ensure its global competitiveness. There is growing urgency to effectively manage and eliminate methane emissions globally, as well as to end routine flaring.Futureproofing projects to strengthen sustainability and climate value and unlocking additional sources of capital domestically will be key to overcoming financing challenges. Addressing the infrastructure and demand-side barriers will require continued regional cooperation, leveraging gas value chains to develop industrial clusters, reforming electricity markets, pricing emissions, and encouraging the adoption of small, scalable technologies. Policy uncertainty and physical security risks that create an unfavourable business climate and discourage investment also need to be urgently addressed.Fortunately, successful African case studies detailed in the report demonstrate that there are many local solutions and opportunities to achieve gasification, as well as emissions reductions.The Executive Director, Africa Energy Commission, Rashid Abdallah stressed:“Natural gas is a resource that has a significant role to play in bringing about socio-economic development and mitigating climate change in Africa. As part of a just transition, Africa requires gas to contribute to eradicating energy poverty, providing electricity to almost 50% of Africans, playing as catalyst in the provision of clean cooking technologies to nearly billion Africans and creating jobs. The calls for an immediate end to all fossil fuel utilisation, and request for global capital investors to stop funding gas projects will severely impact Africa’s socio-economic development.”The CEO of Africa Finance Corporation, Samaila Zubairu, commented:“The global energy market is in an unprecedented state of flux, opening significant opportunities for exploration and development of gas in Africa. At the same time, gas is key to helping Africa end its energy poverty quickly and affordably, by providing an alternative to wood fuel, which would lift hundreds of millions out of poverty while preserving Africa’s forests – a valuable carbon sink for the world. Gas offers further solutions for Africa’s food security challenges as a key source of critical fertilizers, while also generating needed export revenue for re-investment in renewable solutions.”The IGU President, Madam Li Yalan reiterated:“Access to modern energy in Africa is imperative for its development, for having an ability to respond to climate change, and for gradually decarbonising its economies. Gas is oneof the keys to unlock this access, and it is also a fuel for producing stable and flexible energy needed to integrate more renewables. Using its gas resources together with renewable energy technologies, Africa can build energy systems compatible with a climate- or carbon-neutral future and underpin the continent’s sustainable economic development.”The Director & Head of Research at Hawilti, Mickael Vogel said:“We are delighted to provide stakeholders and policy-makers with an overview of natural gas dynamics in Africa, and hope it will be valuable to underpin dialogue and pragmatic actions to eliminate energy poverty. As an Africa-based research and consultancy company, we will continue to highlight the diversity and complexity of African energy markets and we see gas as a critical contributor to the continent’s development and just energy transition.”

"The natural gas price at the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub declined by 41%, or $2.26 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), in January 2023 compared with December 2022, based on data from Refinitiv Eikon. The price decline was driven by warmer-than-average temperatures across the United States that reduced natural gas consumption for space heating and by increased natural gas production. In our February Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we forecast the natural gas price at the Henry Hub will average $3.40/MMBtu in 2023.Typically, U.S. natural gas prices increase in the winter as temperatures decrease and demand for space heating increases. This past January was the warmest January since 2006. The United States was warmer than normal; it experienced 16% fewer heating degree days (HDDs, a measure of how cold it is) than the 10-year (2013–22) average. As a result, we estimate that in January, natural gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors, combined, was 15% lower (at 40.1 billion cubic feet per day [Bcf/d]) than the five-year (2018–22) average for the month. In addition, an outage at the Freeport LNG liquefied natural gas export facility has resulted in approximately 2.0 Bcf/d less feedgas demand since June 2022. The decreased demand for natural gas contributed to a lower January priceWe estimate that dry natural gas production in January averaged 11% more (at 100.2 Bcf/d) than the five-year average and was up 5% from last January. Strong production combined with less consumption in January reduced natural gas withdrawals from storage by 55%, or 371 Bcf, compared with the five-year average. Natural gas in underground storage in the Lower 48 states as of January 27, 2023, was 7% higher (at 2,583 Bcf) than the five-year average.

"Oil prices rose on Thursday as hopes of a robust fuel demand recovery in top oil consumer China offset losses arising from strength in the greenback and a large build in U.S. crude inventory.Brent crude futures rose 59 cents, or 0.7%, to $85.97 per barrel by 0725 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 73 cents, or 0.9% to $79.32 a barrel.The International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil demand would rise by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023, up 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast to a record 101.9 million bpd, with China making up 900,000 bpd of the increase.China will account for almost half of 2023 oil demand growth after relaxing its COVID-19 curbs, the Paris-based agency said.The U.S. dollar, which generally moves inversely with crude prices, surged on the back of bullish U.S. retail sales data and clung to most of those gains on Thursday.“On China, OPEC and the IEA’s optimistic outlook helped. The net upward thrust countered the weight of the huge U.S. oil stock-build, but I don’t see much more headroom just yet,” said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Insights.U.S. crude oil stocks soared last week by 16.3 million barrels to 471.4 million barrels, the highest level since June 2021, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. The larger-than-expected build was largely due a data adjustment, which analysts said muted the impact to oil prices. [EIA/S]
“Oil prices are expected to swing in a narrow range, caught between the divergent demand-supply dynamics,” said independent market expert Sugandha Sachdeva.
“While the steadily rising U.S. production and swelling inventories combined with a broad recovery in the U.S. dollar are acting as a headwind for oil prices, still the narrative of strong demand revival from China and prospects of Russia-linked output cuts is jacking up oil prices,” Sachdeva added.
Around 1 million bpd of oil production will be shut by the end of the first quarter, the IEA said, following the European ban on seaborne imports and international price cap sanctions.
Analysts at Commonwealth Bank pointed out in a note that OPEC+ will not look to boost output to compensate for lower Russian output.
That means the onus will be on the United States and other non-OPEC producers to boost output not only to make up for lower Russian output, but also to meet any incremental increase in global oil demand, the note added.

"Leading scenarios for energy demand in 2050 continue to diverge massively amid uncertainty over climate policies and how the global energy industry will cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report published by the International Energy Forum (IEF).The 24 energy demand outlooks analyzed by the IEF showed a divergence between the highest and lowest scenarios of 92 million barrels a day (mb/d) by 2050 for oil and 5,100 billion cubic meters (bcm) for natural gas by 2050, roughly equal to the size of the global market today. The range of projections for renewable energy demand in 2050 was four times greater than current global renewables market.“The wide range in scenarios underscores the uncertainty in future energy demand, the wide-ranging potential impact of policies, and the immense challenge ahead for achieving just and orderly transitions,” said Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the IEF.The IEF published its updated energy outlooks comparison report ahead of the 13th Symposium on Energy Outlooks, held jointly with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the IEF headquarters in Riyadh on Wednesday. The symposium brought together policymakers, experts and industry leaders to help them address the simultaneous crises affecting the global climate, energy market and economySince last year’s symposium, long-term demand uncertainty has been compounded by acute near-term risks, particularly in oil and gas markets, fuelling price volatility and harming consumers, investors, businesses, and governments, Mr McMonigle said.“The only sure antidote to high energy prices and volatility is adequate investment in new supplies. Underinvestment threatens to undermine energy security and can also stall progress on climate goals by risking public support for climate action and increasing reliance on more carbon-intensive options in the short-term,” he told the symposium.In the IEF’s comparison of the six main energy outlooks from the IEA and OPEC, there were some areas of agreement about 2030. All base case scenarios showed an 8-12 percent increase in primary energy demand by the end of this decade, with non-OECD countries driving the growth.Low-carbon energy sources including renewable, hydro, biomass, and nuclear were expected to grow by a total 32-67 percent by 2030 in all six scenarios, the report found. Coal demand was expected to fall by 2030 in all six scenarios, although the size of the decline ranges from 5 percent to 46 percent.By 2045, three of the six scenarios saw robust growth in primary energy demand. However, the IEA’s net zero scenario showed primary energy demand plummeting by 15 percent, projecting a break with the historical relationship between economic growth and energy demand growth.“Energy investment decisions are informed by energy demand outlooks and scenarios. While aspirational scenarios are essential for tracking progress towards climate goals, it is equally important to provide outlooks based on current policy and consumer trends. Investment decisions should be based on realistic scenarios and real-time market data to prevent supply shortfalls,” Mr McMonigle said.Four of the six core scenarios showed fossil fuels accounting for more than 50 percent of primary energy in 2045, versus a current share of approximately 80 percent.The IEF also gathered data on 18 additional scenarios from seven sources to understand how IEA and OPEC projections compared against other industry-leading outlooks.Three quarters of all 24 scenarios showed primary energy demand in 2050 at higher levels than 2021, the report said. Forecasts for total liquids demand in 2050 diverged by 92 mb/d – almost the size of today’s global market. Scenarios based on current trends and policies showed demand plateauing, while net zero scenarios showed a peak and collapse.More than half of all scenarios to 2050 showed coal demand falling by more than half, fossil fuels accounting for more half of total primary energy demand and nuclear power increasing by more than 50 percent.Most scenarios showed electricity demand growing by 80 percent by 2050, with more ambitious net zero scenarios showing up to 200 percent growth versus 2021.Most net zero scenarios show carbon capture expanding to 6-8 Gigatons of CO2 per year by 2050, the report said.

"The US Energy Information Administration is widely expected to announce another tepid drawdown from US natural gas storage in early February, further widening the surplus, as mild weather and correspondingly weak demand continue to drive a supply overhang weighing on the US gas market.In the week ended Feb. 10, US gas inventories likely fell 109 Bcf, according to the latest survey of market analysts by S&P Global Commodity Insights. Storage withdrawal estimates were reported in a wider range, with analysts predicting drawdowns ranging from 80 Bcf to as much as 127 Bcf.This week’s consensus withdrawal of 109 Bcf would undershoot the average 166 Bcf drawdown reported over the past five years. The estimate also falls dramatically below the year-ago pull of 195 Bcf, data from EIA shows.If the market’s anticipated storage withdrawal is accurate, US stocks would fall to 2.257 Tcf, widening the storage surplus to 174 Bcf, or more than 8%, above the five-year average. The withdrawal would also move domestic inventories to a surplus of 319 Bcf, or almost 17%, above the year-ago level.Fundamentals
On Feb. 14, the NYMEX March futures contract was up about 20 cents from the prior-day settlement to trade around $2.61/MMBtu, intraday exchange data from CME Group showed.Over the past eight weeks, prompt-month futures prices have lost more than 60% of their value, plummeting on exceptionally mild winter temperatures, low US heating demand and bearish winter weather forecasts — compounded by an eight-month outage at the Freeport LNG export terminal.Over the weekend, Freeport LNG exported its first LNG cargo since a June 8 fire shut the Texas facility, giving futures traders a glimmer of hope that the terminal’s restart could soon help to balance a host of other bearish factors. The Freeport terminal can take more than 2 Bcf/d when operating fully. The terminal’s restart promises to tighten supply in the US Gulf Coast gas market, helping to reduce the domestic supply overhang.“Looks like we’re getting a little bit of a Freeport bounce today,” said Phil Flynn, senior account executive at Price Futures Group, by telephone Feb. 14.“Obviously it’s been a long process and there’s still a regulatory hurdle to get through, but it does look like this thing is finally getting ready to move and that’s given us a little bit of support — and let’s face it, this weather is not very helpful at all,” he said.Freeport was scheduled to receive more than 700 MMcf/d of feedgas Feb. 14, based on nominations for the morning cycle that could later be revised, S&P Global Commodity Insights data showed. The scheduled deliveries to Freeport were up from nearly 430 MMcf/d Feb. 13, which marked the highest volume of daily feedgas deliveries to the terminal since the outage began.
OutlookFollowing a nearly 19 Bcf/d weather-fueled decline in US gas demand last week, short-term forecasts from the National Weather Service show mild temperatures continuing in the Midwest and across the Eastern Seaboard — both key heating-demand regions — through late February. According to a seasonal outlook from the agency, a risk for mild weather in both regions continues into March and potentially through April.
S&P Global’s latest supply-demand model estimate is already calling for a smaller withdrawal from US inventory for the week in progress, further weighing on the market’s bearish outlook. According to the latest projection, US storage withdrawals will likely total just 70 Bcf in the current week. If the projection is accurate, domestic inventories would drop below 2.2 Tcf, but it would still widen the surplus to the five-year average and the year-ago level

"The IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the world’s most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market – including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.Nearly a year on from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global oil markets are trading in relative calm. Oil prices are back to pre-war levels with the exception of diesel, though even these have drifted much lower from last summer’s historical highs. World oil supply looks set to exceed demand through the first half of 2023, but the balance could quickly shift to deficit as demand recovers and some Russian output is shut in.Russian oil production and exports have held up relatively well despite sanctions. The country has managed to reroute shipments of crude to Asia and the G7 price cap on crude appears to be helping to keep the barrels flowing. In January, output was down only 160 kb/d from pre-war levels, with a lofty 8.2 mb/d of oil shipped to markets. But in a sign that Moscow may be struggling to place all of its barrels, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in early February that Russia would curb output by 500 kb/d in March rather than sell to countries that comply with the G7 price caps.The cut may be an attempt to shore up oil prices. In January, Moscow was forced to sell exports at a large discount. Their 2023 budget is based on a Urals price of $70.10/bbl, but the grade’s export price averaged just $49.48/bbl in January versus $82/bbl for North Sea Dated. As a result, Russia’s fiscal revenues from oil operations plunged 48% y-o-y in January to 310 billion roubles (or $4.2 bn), while export revenues dropped 36% to $13 billion.With Russian oil production in decline and limited gains expected from the rest of the OPEC+ bloc, non-OPEC+ producers will lead world supply growth in 2023. For the year as a whole, global oil supply is forecast to expand by 1.2 mb/d, led by the United States, Brazil, Norway, Canada and Guyana – all set to pump at record rates. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, along with the UAE, will also produce near all-time highs, leaving a thin spare capacity cushion of roughly 3.4 mb/d.At the same time, world oil demand growth is picking up after a marked slowdown in the second half of 2022 and a year-on-year contraction in the fourth quarter. China accounts for nearly half the 2 mb/d projected increase this year, with neighbouring countries also set to benefit after Beijing ditched its zero-Covid policies. A pronounced uptick in air traffic in recent weeks emphasises the central role of jet fuel deliveries in 2023 growth – expected to soar by 1.1 mb/d to reach 7.2 mb/d, around 90% of 2019 levels. Total demand will hit a record 101.9 mb/d, 1.4 mb/d more than the 2019 average.The impact on Russia’s product exports following the EU embargo and price cap that came into effect on 5 February will be a key factor when it comes to meeting that demand growth. So will Beijing’s stance on domestic refinery activity and product exports amid its reopening. New refineries in Africa and the Middle East as well as China are expected to step in to cater for the growth in refined product demand. If the price cap on products is half as successful as the crude cap, product markets may well weather the storm – but more crude supplies would be required to prevent renewed stock draws later in the year.

"Oil prices slid about 2% to a one-week low on Wednesday on a much bigger-than-expected U.S. crude stock build and expectations of further interest rate hikes, though forecasts for higher 2023 demand growth limited losses.U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 16.3 million barrels last week to 471.4 million barrels, their highest since June 2021, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.That was much higher than the 1.2 million-barrel increase that analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and compares and the 10.5 million-barrel increase shown in data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry trade group. ,Analysts said an unusually large crude oil supply adjustment in the EIA data contributed to the outsized build.“It’s the worst kind of build that you can possibly have. It’s all about the …. adjustment number. There’s no getting around that,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, a bank.Brent futures fell $1.35, or 1.6%, to $84.23 a barrel by 11:11 a.m. EST (1611 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $1.46, or 1.9%, to $77.60.That puts both Brent and WTI on track for their lowest closes since Feb. 7.U.S. inflation data and remarks by central bank officials that have been perceived as indications that interest rates will go higher for longer also weighed on the market.Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday said that the U.S. central bank will need to maintain gradual increases to interest rates to beat inflation and suggested that price pressures driven by a hot jobs market could push borrowing costs higher than previously expected.Also applying downward pressure on crude was the announcement this week that the United States would sell 26 million barrels of oil from the nation’s strategic reserve, which is already at its lowest level in about four decades.Lending some support was Wednesday’s report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which raised its forecast for 2023 oil demand growth and said that restrained OPEC+ production could bring a supply deficit in the second half.OPEC+ includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil suppliers including Russia.The IEA said that about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of production from OPEC+ member Russia will be shut in by the end of the first quarter, citing a European ban on seaborne imports and a Group of Seven (G7) price cap over the invasion of Ukraine.The G7 is a group of seven countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.On Tuesday OPEC also raised its projection for global oil demand growth and pointed to a tighter market in 2023.

"Egypt is seeking investment in all aspects of energy production, whether it be in traditional fossil fuels or renewables, the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Tarek El Molla has said.“I cannot say that we will do one bucket on the account of the other. We have to do them all,” Mr El Molla said at the Egypt Petroleum Show in Cairo on Tuesday.“We need investments in exploration, we need investments in [the energy] transition, we need investments in renewables, we need investments in decarbonisation … We need investments in all aspects and I wouldn’t prioritise any of them.”Oil demand is set to reach 102 million barrels a day this year and increase to 110 million bpd by 2025, Opec Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said at the opening of the industry conference on Sunday.The disruption of the market following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago has pushed up the prices of oil and natural gas, particularly in the heavily dependent European market.Oil prices closed 2022 with a second straight annual gain with Brent gaining about 10 per cent and US crude rising about 7 per cent.Wholesale prices of electricity and gas in Europe have surged as much as 15-fold since early 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund.Egypt, which hosted the UN climate conference Cop27 in November, has committed to sourcing 42 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, from about 20 per cent currently.However, as the country suffers from the economic fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war, it is also looking for ways to solve its foreign currency crunch and maximise its natural gas exports as Europe looks for new energy suppliers.Mr El Molla said earlier this week that the state is planning to offer three international gas and oil tenders this year and has an “ambitious plan” to drill more than 300 exploration wells by 2025.“Because we have seen the prices of oil and gas are extremely high now … this will have a negative impact on many economies in the world. Therefore, we need to increase the production of these fossil fuels, but in a responsible manner,” Mr El Molla said.“Otherwise, less investments means less production, that means higher prices, and it is going to be a vicious cycle.”Natural gasEgypt expects to produce about 7.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas this year, in line with production in 2022, when it shipped 80 per cent of its LNG to Europe, said Mr El Molla.The North African country and Israel signed a framework agreement with the EU in June to increase LNG sales to European countries. Under the deal, Israeli gas is transported by pipeline to Egypt’s LNG plants before being shipped to Europe.But expansion in export capacity under the deal will take time and significant investments, industry leaders said during a panel discussion on Tuesday.Egypt has the capacity to export about 13 million tonnes annually through its Idku and Damietta plants, said Magdy Galal, head of state-run operator EGas.Adding five production trains to the two plants could bring total capacity to more than 30 million tonnes, but “it is not cheap”, Mr Galal said.Yossi Abu, chief executive of Israel’s NewMed Energy, said he was confident the two countries would reach a final agreement “that creates a win-win to everybody”.ExplorationIn Egypt, Chevron and Eni recently made a “significant” gas discovery at their Nargis block off North Sinai, reportedly in the range of 100 billion cubic metres. Each company holds a 45 per cent interest while state-owned Tharwa Petroleum holds the remaining 10 per cent.Chevron entered the Egyptian market in 2020, picking up four exploration blocks and another two when it acquired Noble Energy.It also has a 40 per cent stake in Israel’s mammoth gasfield Leviathan and 25 per cent in Tamar.Chevron International’s president for exploration and production Clay Neff said at the conference on Tuesday that the US company is “pursuing some very important expansion of those assets”.While Chevron has committed to lowering its emissions to 35 per cent by 2028 and reaching net zero by 2050, Mr Neff said that “gas is going to play a key role for decades to come”.“We’re unapologetically going to grow our traditional business. We know the world needs it,” he said.Chevron and Egypt’s Petroleum Ministry also signed an agreement this week to co-operate on projects to lower its carbon footprint, including reducing methane emissions.Chevron has halved its methane emissions since 2016, according to Mr Neff.Several industry leaders spoke of the energy “trilemma” of affordability, availability and sustainability.“We need to keep now a firm eye on where we are going, how to turn this crisis into a foundation for a more sustainable energy future,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said at the event.

"India’s ONGC is actively pursuing discussions with oil majors seeking partnerships to accelerate domestic exploration plans while keeping an eye on overseas upstream opportunities, an analysis by S&P Global Commodity Insights showed.The development signals ONGC’s continued focus at both home and abroad to boost oil and gas output despite the push towards cleaner fuels.ONGC, which contributes two-thirds of the country’s oil and gas output, is also keeping a close eye on events in Russia where the company, through its international arm ONGC Videsh Ltd., has a sizeable presence, delegates who attended the India Energy Week told S&P Global.ONGC has stepped up discussions with ExxonMobil, Equinor, the American oil services conglomerate Baker Hughes, and French research organization Institut Français du Pétrole on various issues like technology and deepwater collaboration.“Energy security is geography dependent. The world is now getting balanced as deep sea investments are becoming economical. The transition to renewables is a reality. However, oil and gas will remain in focus in the journey,” said Arun Kumar Singh, ONGC’s chairman and CEO.ONGC’s strategic long-term growth path would include expansion of deepwater oil and gas exploration, enhanced oil recovery, boosting renewables capacity, building carbon capture, utilization and sequestration capabilities, as well as playing a key role in India’s push towards a hydrogen economy, according to top company officials.Upstream investment plansONGC officials said the company had set a target of investing $3.5 billion in lifting oil and gas output over the next 3-4 years from its western offshore assets, in line with its effort to ramp up oil recovery from its flagship asset at Mumbai High in Gulf of Cambay region.The offshore assets in the western region produce 41.5 million cu m/day of gas and around 260,000 b/d of crude, said Pankaj Kumar, director of offshore assets, on the sidelines of the India Energy Week.In 2021-22 (April-March), ONGC’s crude oil and condensate output fell 3.7% on the year to 21.71 million mt, or 155 million barrels, while its total gas output dropped 5% on the year to 21.68 Bcm.“We are open to any type of partnership with private players to raise output in our oil and gas assets,” Kumar said.ONGC plans to produce oil and gas from its ultra deepwater assets in the eastern offshore of the Krishna-Godavari basin at KG98/2 block from May, Kumar said, adding that ONGC would produce at least 10,000 b/d initially at the KG98/2 block, and then to a peak level of 45,000 b/d by the end of the current year.The Russia factorOVL currently has a stake in 32 oil and gas projects in 15 countries.Recently, OVL signed an agreement with YPF SA of Argentina to enhance cooperation between the two companies in the energy sector, such as exploration and development of upstream oil and gas opportunities.Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in early-2022, the strategy of OVL has been in focus, considering many international companies severed ties with Moscow.“ONGC’s Russian assets have a primary international position in the company’s portfolio. While the share of new volumes from Russia is limited, the country is essential for maintaining OVL’s base production and accompanying cashflows, which will support growth projects in other parts of its portfolio,” said Rajeev Lala, associate director, upstream companies and transactions, at S&P Global.“With the exit of international oil companies, technical and operational burdens for fields that are difficult to develop will be the responsibility of new operators — essentially, but not solely Rosneft. Asset monetization could be a very long-term prospect if ONGC were to buy into new Russian assets,” Lala added.Between 2022-2031, Russia is expected to account for an average of 54% of OVL’s total entitlement production, according to S&P Global estimates.Russia’s reliance on hydrocarbon receipts grew last year, as sanctions took a toll on other parts of the economy. This means government’s revenue needs will retain primacy over investor returns, which heightens risks for any potential foreign buyer of Russian assets, including ONGC, he added.Production of light sweet Sokol crude at the Sakhalin 1 project came to a halt in Q2 2022 after previous operator ExxonMobil declared force majeure and exited the project.Following ExxonMobil’s exit, a new Russian entity managed by Rosneft subsidiary Sakhalinmorneftegaz-Shelf took over the operatorship, while foreign equity holders of the project were asked to apply to Moscow to retain their stakes.“The exodus of oil companies from Russia presents significant challenges for ONGC. The Sakhalin I project is one of ONGC’s most profitable assets, but the absence of ExxonMobil’s technical and operational capability will hamper operations, and likely profits, at the project,” said Mansi Anand, senior research analyst at S&P Global.
According to trade sources, increasingly more Far East Russia’s Sokol crude cargoes are finding homes in India following the grade’s return to the export market in October 2022, as its traditional buyers in North Asia ceased to purchase the grade following the war.

"Russia’s State Duma introduced a bill late on Saturday setting discounts for Russian oil exports, according to the lower house of parliament’s website.Under the draft proposal, the discount on dated Brent oil will be limited to $34 per barrel in April, declining to $31 in May, $28 in June and $25 in July.The government has been debating how to calculate Russia’s taxable oil price following the European Union’s import ban and the resulting lack of a reliable price-setting mechanism.Russia currently uses Urals price assessments in Europe’s Rotterdam and Augusta ports, provided by commodity price reporting agency Argus, to determine its mineral extraction tax, additional income tax, oil export duty and reverse excise on oil.On Friday, Reuters reported that Russia plans to fix the price of Urals crude oil at $20 per barrel below dated Brent for tax purposes after state oil revenue slumped in January.Moscow relies on oil and gas income to fund its budget, but has been forced to start selling foreign currency reserves to cover a deficit that stretched to 1.76 trillion roubles ($24.8 billion) in January to cover the cost of the military operation in Ukraine.Urals crude differentials to dated Brent slipped to minus $30 a barrel in December from minus $24 in November, remaining sharply below the single-digit discounts seen prior to 2022.Russia said on Friday it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day, or around 5 per cent of output, in March, following the West’s imposition of price caps on Russian oil and oil products.

"ExxonMobil’s recent announcement of the sale of its Italian and Thai assets is the latest in a series of divestment moves by the oil Majors. But how much more rationalisation is likely?Our report ExxonMobil exits Italy and Thailand: why, and what’s next for the Majors? assesses the reasons for ExxonMobil’s decision and looks at the potential for further consolidation by the industry’s key players. Fill out the form to access the full insight, or read on for a short introduction.What exactly is ExxonMobil selling?
ExxonMobil has sold all its Italian fuel and refining assets to private Italian fuel and mobility group IP. The deal is due to close in mid-2023 and hands IP full ownership of the 134,000 barrel-per-day Trecate refinery (it already owned 25%).ExxonMobil has also agreed to dispose of its 65.99% interest in Esso Thailand, this time to Bangchak. That deal should go through in the second half of 2023. It includes the Sriracha refinery, distribution terminals and pipelines, along with a network of 700 Esso-branded retail/service stations.ExxonMobil will, however, continue to supply both markets with branded finished lubricants and chemical products.Why is ExxonMobil parting with these assets?
Trecate doesn’t align with the company’s strategic focus on petrochemicals and lubricants. What’s more, its inland location makes it both less competitive on price and harder to decarbonise. In fact, it ranked in the bottom quartile for global integrated refinery/petrochemical sites in terms of net cash margins (NCM) in 2021.By comparison, Sriracha is a midranking site in terms of NCM. However, it doesn’t fit with ExxonMobil’s future focus, which is on large-scale facilities producing lower-emissions fuels and high-performance products.The chart draws on data from our proprietary Refinery Evaluation Model and Emissions Benchmarking Tool. It shows the integrated carbon emissions intensity and NCM for ExxonMobil’s assets in 2021, including Trecate and Sriracha.How likely are further divestments by the Majors?
For most of the Majors, some further divestment of non-core assets is desirable.ExxonMobil has a number of refinery-only sites that don’t fit with its long-term strategy. BP is down to six refineries but needs to get rid of at least one more to meet its 2030 goal to reduce refinery capacity. Shell has identified five key petrochemically integrated assets and needs to divest others. TotalEnergies could choose to sell its remaining standalone refineries rather than convert them to bio-sites. And Chevron still owns sites which weaken its strategic focus on downstream decarbonisation.However, a lack of obvious buyers, coupled with the strength of short-term refinery margins, reduces the urgency of further divestment. Sales of further assets are therefore likely to be opportunistic rather than strategic.You can get our view on potential candidates for future divestment for ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, TotalEnergies and Chevron in the full report. This also includes further detail on the ExxonMobil deals, as well as a series of charts analysing NCM, emissions intensity and other statistics for the Majors’ individual assets.

"Commodity trading house Mercuria doesn’t see a big impact on crude oil markets from Russia’s decision to cut its oil output, its CEO told Reuters, adding the move could narrow the price discount for Russian exports.Russia said last week it would cut its production by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), or around 5%, in March, after the West imposed price caps on Russian oil and products.“I don’t think it will have a big impact,” Marco Dunand said on the sidelines of the World Government Summit on Monday.“The Russians are concerned about the differential they are getting from their crude, they are selling their crude at large discounts,” he added.Dunand said the cut could help narrow the discount to benchmark Brent crude to about $20 per barrel from the current $40.The G7, European Union and Australia agreed to ban the use of Western-supplied maritime insurance, finance and brokering for seaborne Russian oil priced above $60 per barrel from Dec. 5 as part of sanctions on Moscow over its war in Ukraine.The EU also imposed a ban on purchases of Russian oil products and set price caps from Feb. 5.In turn, Russia has banned any deals that involve applying the price cap mechanism.Dunand said it was too early to tell what effect the products cap would have on the market.
“The real demand for Russian diesel tends to be in Europe, so they have to find new markets and different ways of blending etc,” he said.Should temporary shortages arise in one place as a result of the price cap, they would eventually “balance out” as there was ample supply to meet demand globally, Dunand said.He also said Europe was better prepared for the coming winter even if Russian gas supply was difficult to predict.Europe is now receiving more supply from other places such as the United States and Nigeria, he said.“If we have a cold winter we could have potential shortages but Europe is much better prepared to go through a cold winter than it was before,” he said.

"A rout in natural gas prices will hurt first-quarter earnings and cash flows at gas producers as hedges – the industry’s version of price insurance – were inadequate to offset the expected losses, analysts and industry experts said.Producers starting the year with fewer hedges than historically will have to sell more gas at the market rate of about $2.45 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), below the breakeven prices for producing gas in some regions, and that may force some companies to reduce drilling and put off completing wells.Hedges, or contracts that lock in prices for future output, help producers protect cash flows against price swings, helping them drill and complete wells – crucial at a time when Europe has looked to the United States for gas.U.S. prices for the heating fuel traded as low as $2.34 per mmBtu this month, down 76% from last year’s August peak and the lowest level since April 2021, on mild winter weather in North America and on weaker exports.The low levels of hedging would drain cash flow as market selling prices are low, said Matt Hagerty, senior energy strategist at FactSet’s BTU Analytics.About 36% of 2023 gas production was hedged at the end of September, according to consultancy Energy Aspects, which tracked 40 publicly traded gas producers. That percentage was down from 52% a year earlier.Producers entered in to only two to three swap deals per month from April to October last year, said David Seduski, natural gas analyst at Energy Aspects, referring to a type of hedge. He called that amount “incredibly minimal” and said it compared with 30 to 50 such trades per month in 2021.A rally in prices in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced a lot of producers already hedged at lower prices to take on hedging losses. That may have encouraged them to hedge less.“Last year was pretty jarring for folks, who weren’t ready for the uptick in price. A lot of folks probably sold off those hedges and wanted to be exposed to the upside and might see themselves in the predicament they’re in now,” said Trisha Curtis, chief executive of energy consultancy PetroNerds added.EQT Corp, the top U.S. producer of natural gas, last month said it expects a $4.6 billion loss on derivatives for 2022, and net cash settlements of $5.9 billion. No. 2 producer Southwestern Energy Co posted a $6.71 billion loss on derivatives for the first nine months of 2022.RISKY STRATEGIES
Some companies have let their hedges expire, increasing exposure to current prices. Antero Resources Corp said in October that the vast majority of its hedges would roll off by Jan 1.Another type of hedge, known as a three-way collar, could backfire because of the extent of the fall in prices, analysts said. These transactions have a producer buy an agreement to sell natural gas at one price, called a put, while also selling a put at a lower price in hopes of pocketing the premium from its buyer.Effectively, this is a calculated bet that gas will fall to a certain level and no further. But when it falls below the predicted lower price, it takes away some of the benefits of the hedge.Chesapeake Energy Corp, for example, bought puts for 900 million cubic feet at $3.40 per million cubic feet (mmcf), while also selling puts for $2.50 mmcf for the first quarter, according to a November presentation.Were gas prices to average $2.36 per mmcf, the company would pay out 14 cents per mmcf, reducing the gains from the hedge.Antero and Chesapeake did not respond to a request for a comment.Denver-based Ovintiv Inc, previously Encana, also said it had sold puts for 400 mmcfpd at $2.75 per mmcf for the first quarter of 2023, according to a November press release. That would erode the gains from the hedges by about 39 cents per mmcf.On the other hand, companies that locked in higher prices on average during the run-up in prices late last year could see gains, Rystad Energy senior analyst Matthew Bernstein said.While overall hedging was lower, the average $3.16 per mmBtu was higher than a year earlier, he added. EQT, for example, has hedged about 58% of its total production at an average of about $3.40 per mmBtu, higher than current market prices.Ovintiv and EQT did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

"Energy – Higher demand for OPEC oil
Oil prices settled lower yesterday as the market digested the US SPR release announcement, while the YoY US CPI print also came in above expectations, which will have weighed further on prices. The market has continued to trade weaker this morning after some bearish API data was released overnight with US inventories increasing across the board last week. US crude oil inventories grew by 10.51MMbbls, while Cushing crude oil inventories increased by 1.95MMbbls. For refined products, gasoline and distillate fuel oil stocks increased by 846Mbbls and 1.73MMbbls respectively.OPEC released its latest monthly oil market report yesterday. This showed that OPEC production over January averaged 28.88MMbbls/d, down 49Mbbls/d MoM. Saudi Arabia saw the largest decline over the month with output falling by 156Mbbls/d. For 2023 the group revised lower its non-OPEC supply growth estimate by 100Mbbls/d to 1.44MMbbls/d YoY, while global oil demand growth forecasts were increased by 100Mbbls/d to 2.32MMbbls/d YoY. As a result, the call on OPEC production over 2023 is 29.42MMbbls/d, above January production of 28.88MMbbls/d. The call on OPEC supply is strongest in 4Q23, standing at 30.43MMbbls/d. The IEA will release its monthly oil market report today, which will also give the agency’s latest outlook for the market.Bloomberg reports that the European Commission is set to have talks on whether voluntary demand cuts in the European gas market need to be extended beyond March. Previously EU members agreed on voluntary demand cuts of 15% below the 5-year average for the period August 2022 to March 2023. We believe that Europe will need to continue to see demand destruction through the course of the year in order to ensure the market is kept in balance. However, we believe demand cuts needed beyond March can be more modest at around 10%. This assumes we see no further declines in Russian pipeline gas flows to the region.Metals – Aluminium smelters in Europe still facing challenges
Despite the recent drop in energy prices, aluminium smelters in Europe still face challenges, Norsk Hydro has said.

The company expects zinc supply to remain tight and sees a supply deficit of 150kt in 2023, the third annual deficit in a row. It expects zinc prices to range between $3,000 and $3,400/t in the first half of the year.Agriculture – France raises winter-grain planting estimates

"Oil dropped for a second day on Wednesday, as an industry report pointed to ample supplies in the United States and anticipation of further interest rate hikes sparked concerns over weaker fuel demand and the economic outlook.U.S. crude stocks rose by a more-than-forecast 10.5 million barrels, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute (API) figures, ahead of official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data out at 1530 GMT.“Simply put, the U.S. is swimming in oil,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.Brent crude futures slid $1.13, or 1.3%, to $84.45 a barrel by 0910 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped $1.31, or 1.7% to $77.75.U.S. inflation data and remarks from central bank officials that have spurred investor worries that interest rates are going to be higher for longer also weighed on the market.Federal Reserve officials said on Tuesday the U.S. central bank will need to keep gradually raising interest rates to beat inflation and suggested price pressures driven by a hot jobs market may push borrowing costs higher than they once thought.Also putting downward pressure on crude was the U.S. announcement this week that it would sell 26 million barrels of oil from the nation’s strategic reserve, which is already at its lowest level in roughly four decades.Lending some support was Tuesday’s Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries report, in which the group made its first upward revision to global oil demand growth in months and trimmed the non-OPEC supply outlook, pointing to a tighter market in 2023.The International Energy Agency, in its report on Wednesday, also boosted its 2023 demand forecast.

"OPEC has raised its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth in its first upward revision for months, citing China’s relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions and slightly stronger prospects for the world economy.Global oil demand will rise this year by 2.32 million barrels per day (bpd), or 2.3%, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Tuesday in a monthly report. The projection was 100,000 bpd higher than last month’s forecast.Higher demand could support oil prices that have held relatively steady since the end of last year and stand at a little less than $86 a barrel. OPEC had kept its 2023 demand growth forecast steady for the past two months after a series of downgrades.“Key to oil demand growth in 2023 will be the return of China from its mandated mobility restrictions and the effect this will have on the country, the region and the world,” OPEC said in the report.“Concern hovers around the depth and pace of the country’s economic recovery and the consequent impact on oil demand.”OPEC expects Chinese demand to grow by 590,000 bpd in 2023, up from last month’s forecast at 510,000 bpd. China’s oil consumption dropped for the first time in years in 2022, held back by its COVID containment measures.The OPEC report was upbeat on economic prospects, nudging up its 2023 global growth forecast to 2.6% from 2.5%, though it said that a relative slowdown remained evident and cited high inflation and expected further increases to interest rates.Other upside factors for oil are the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will manage a soft landng for the U.S. economy and further commodity price weakness, OPEC said.On the flipside, it noted a number of factors that could curb economic growth and oil demand.“Downside risks are apparent and may include further geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, China’s ongoing domestic challenges amid the pandemic and potential spillovers from China’s still fragile real estate sector,” OPEC said.The report also showed that OPEC’s crude oil production fell in January after the wider OPEC+ alliance pledged output cuts to support the market. Output declined in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, offsetting increases elsewhere.OPEC said its crude oil output in January fell by 49,000 bpd to 28.88 million bpd.

The ICE Brent front-month increased by $2.57, or 3.2%, to average $83.91/b, and NYMEX WTI rose by $1.64, or 2.1%, to average $78.16/b. The Brent/WTI futures spread widened m-o-m, rising by 93¢ to average $5.75/b. The market structure of ICE Brent strengthened in January, and the first-to-third month spread flipped into backwardation. However, the forward curve of NYMEX WTI weakened further, and the first-to-third month spread moved into deeper contango. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined futures and options net long positions in January in both ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI, compared to December’s low levels.World EconomyThe world economic growth forecast for 2022 is revised up slightly to 3.1%, given the better-than-anticipated 2H22 economic performance in various key economies. The 2023 global economic growth forecast is also revised up slightly to 2.6% with some of the 2H22 momentum carrying over into 2023. For the US, the economic growth forecast is revised up to 2.1% for 2022 and 1.2% for 2023. Similarly, the Euro-zone’s economic growth is revised up to 3.5% for 2022 and 0.8% for 2023. Japan’s economic growth forecast remains at 1.2% for 2022, but is revised up to 1.2% for 2023. China’s economic growth forecast for 2022 is revised down to 3%, but is revised up to 5.2% for 2023. India’s economic growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.8% for 2022 and 5.6% for 2023. Brazil’s economic growth forecast remains at 2.8% for 2022 and is also unchanged at 1% for 2023. The 2022 economic growth forecast for Russia is revised up to a contraction of 3.5%, followed by a small contraction of 0.5% in 2023, unchanged from last month. While principally the current economic momentum provides a good base for this year’s growth, a slowing dynamic for the year is still likely with inflation remaining high and further lifts in key interest rates, particularly in the Euro-zone. The world economy will continue to navigate through numerous challenges including high sovereign debt levels in many regions and geopolitical developments.World Oil DemandThe world oil demand growth forecast for 2022 remains unchanged from last month’s assessment at 2.5 mb/d. The OECD demand in 4Q22 was adjusted downward to reflect the latest data but non-OECD demand in 4Q22 was revised higher due to improvements in economic activity in some countries and a slight recovery in oil demand in China after the lifting of its zero-COVID-19 policy. For 2023, world oil demand growth is adjusted slightly upwards by 0.1 mb/d to stand at 2.3 mb/d. The OECD is projected to grow by around 0.4 mb/d and non-OECD at about 2.0 mb/d.World Oil SupplyNon-OPEC liquids supply is estimated to have grown by 1.9 mb/d in 2022, broadly unchanged from the previous assessment. Downward revisions to Other Eurasia, OECD Europe and Other Asia were largely offset by upward revisions to liquids production in Russia. The main drivers of liquids supply growth for 2022 are seen to be the US, Russia, Canada, Guyana, China and Brazil, while the largest declines are expected from Norway and Thailand. For 2023, non-OPEC liquids production growth is revised slightly down by 0.1 mb/d from last month and is forecast to grow by 1.4 mb/d. The main drivers of liquids supply growth are expected to be the US, Norway, Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan and Guyana, while declines are forecast in Russia and Mexico. Nevertheless, large uncertainties remain over the impact of ongoing geopolitical developments, as well as US shale output in 2023. OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids are forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d in 2022 to average 5.39 mb/d and by 50 tb/d to average 5.44 mb/d in 2023. OPEC-13 crude oil production in January decreased by 49 tb/d m-o-m to average 28.88 mb/d, according to available secondary sources.Product Markets and Refining OperationsRefinery margins reversed trends in January and strengthened substantially in all main trading hubs, with sizeable margin gains registered, particularly in the Atlantic Basin, backed by a firm recovery in gasoline’s performance. In the US, a drop in jet/kerosene inventories drove up that products’ crack spread, to become the largest margin contributor across the barrel, followed by gasoline. In Europe, robust gasoline exports to the US, amid stronger product buying interest within the region ahead of the 5th of February sanctions on Russian products, supported the products market, particularly at the top section of the barrel. In Asia, the recent lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China, the boost in transport activity around the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, the improvement in petrochemical activities and unplanned refinery outages in the country have all contributed to significant support for Asian naphtha and gasoline markets despite losses at the bottom of the barrel.Tanker MarketDirty freight rates continued the previous month’s decline in January, with m-o-m losses across all monitored routes. Rates slipped from elevated levels, after having been being pushed higher in previous months amid concerns about potential disruptions due to sanctions on Russian crude. However, the upward pressure eased as crude trade flows have largely adjusted ahead of the implementation of sanctions and as Russian crude was seen trading below price cap levels. VLCCs rates on the Middle East-to-East route declined 36% m-o-m in January, while Suezmax rates on the US Gulf-to-Europe route dropped 37% over the same period. Aframax rates on the Indonesia-to-East route gave up the gains seen in the previous month, declining 19%. Clean rates fell for the first time since October, down 42% East of Suez and 52% West of Suez. Some of the downward pressure was due to many ship owners choosing to forego carrying Russian cargos ahead of sanctions, limiting demand for their tankers.Crude and Refined ProductsTrade Preliminary data shows US crude imports hitting a three-year high in January, averaging 6.6 mb/d. US crude exports fell back to 3.6 mb/d in January, after remaining around 4 mb/d over the previous three months. Japan’s crude imports hit a five-month high in December, averaging just under 3.0 mb/d. Japan’s product imports, including LPG, recorded an 11-month high in December, driven by inflows of heating fuel. China’s crude imports were steady in December, averaging 11.4 mb/d. China’s import of Russian crude remained broadly unchanged, while strong m-o-m increases were seen from Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq. Product exports from China strengthened further in December to reach the highest since April 2020, with gasoline, gasoil and jet fuel outflows increasing sharply. India’s crude imports were broadly stable m-o-m in December, averaging 4.6 mb/d. India’s product imports continued to edge higher in December to stand at a 22-month high of 1.2 mb/d, as a jump in fuel oil inflows outweighed declines in gasoline and LPG. India’s product exports surged 31% m-o-m to a nine-month high, with gains seen across the barrel. Estimates show OECD crude imports broadly stable y-o-y in January, despite a sharp drop in pipeline flows, while refined product exports were higher over the same period.Commercial Stock MovementsPreliminary December data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks down 10.9 mb from the previous month. At 2,768 mb, inventories were 117 mb higher than the same month a year ago, 95 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 158 mb below the 2015–2019 average. Within the components, crude stocks rose by 5.2 mb, while product stocks fell m-o-m by 16.2 mb. At 1,344 mb, OECD crude stocks were 72 mb higher than the same time a year ago, but 36 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 83 mb lower than the 2015–2019 average. OECD product stocks stood at 1,424 mb, representing a surplus of 45 mb from the same time in the previous year, but 59 mb lower than the latest five-year average and 75 mb below the 2015–2019 average. In terms of days of forward cover, OECD commercial stocks rose m-o-m by 0.3 day in December to stand at 60.1 days. This is 2.2 days above levels seen in the same month last year, but 2.5 days less than the latest five-year average and 2.3 days lower than the 2015–2019 average.Balance of Supply and DemandDemand for OPEC crude in 2022 remains unchanged from the previous month’s assessment to stand at 28.6 mb/d. This is around 0.5 mb/d higher than in 2021. Demand for OPEC crude in 2023 is revised up by 0.2 mb/d from the previous assessment to stand at 29.4 mb/d, which is 0.8 mb/d higher than in 2022.

"The global oil and gas industry’s profits in 2022 jumped to some $4 trillion from an average of $1.5 trillion in recent years, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, said on Tuesday.Despite those profits, countries depending on oil and gas revenue should prepare to reduce their reliance on petroleum as demand is going to fall in the longer term, Birol told a conference in Oslo while speaking via video link.“Especially the countries in the Middle East have to diversify the their economies. In my view, the COP28 (climate summit) could be an excellent milestone to change the destiny of the Middle East countries,” Birol said.“You cannot anymore run a country whose economy is 90% reliant on oil and gas revenues because oil demand will go down,” he added.This year’s United Nations climate talks will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a members of the OPEC group of oil producing countries.

"Alternative energy sources will not be able to replace oil and gas overnight as part of the world’s energy transition efforts, with additional hydrocarbon investment required to meet growing demand, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive has said.Investment in oil and gas has fallen sharply, with upstream investment at about $400 billion in 2022, less than half of the peak in 2014, Amin Nasser said at the Saudi Capital Markets Forum.“The primary reason: pressure from multiple directions to discontinue all new investments in oil and gas. Pressure based on what I strongly believe are flawed assumptions and arguments,” he said.“Popular energy transition narratives paint a picture of a utopian world where alternatives are ready to replace oil and gas overnight.”They also assume that “less-than-reliable” electric grids in many developing countries can be transformed instantly.But this is “rhetoric” rather than “the reality”, Mr Nasser said.“As the energy crisis in Europe has demonstrated, alternatives are not ready to shoulder the heavy burden of global demand,” he said.“Indeed, the world will continue to depend on oil and gas for the foreseeable future, particularly in sectors such as heavy transport, heavy industry and power generation.”Capital investment in renewables increased “significantly” and is estimated to have hit $494 billion in 2022, surpassing that of upstream oil and gas at $446 billion for the year, Rystad Energy said in a report in October.However, with growing oil demand, the industry requires “huge investments” of $12.1 trillion until 2045 to raise production and meet demand, Opec said in a report in November.Demand for oil as a primary fuel is expected to increase to 101 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2045, from 88 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2021, with its share in the energy mix dropping to 29 per cent, from 31 per cent during the period, the oil producers’ group said.“From my perspective, for a less-risky global energy transition, everyone — including capital markets — must take a more realistic view of how the global energy transition will unfold,” Mr Nasser said.The increasing emphasis on investing in environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives is required, he said.The opportunities to invest in energy transition are also growing, with up to $275 trillion in cumulative spending required by 2050 to achieve net-zero ambitions, according to some estimates.“However, if ESG-driven policies are implemented with an automatic bias against any and all conventional energy projects, the resulting underinvestment will have serious implications — for the global economy, for energy affordability and for energy security.”While $1.1 trillion was committed last year towards the global energy transition, investment in two critical areas — carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen — accounted for less than 1 per cent of this total.The current “investment imbalance is leading us down a dangerous path”, he said.“Capital markets have an obvious opportunity to concurrently address the ‘trilemma’ of energy affordability, energy security and sustainability,” Mr Nasser said.This will involve restoring investment in vital conventional energy sources, increasing investment in technology that reduces the carbon footprint of oil and gas, and investing in new energy sources such as renewables, as well as blue and green hydrogen, he said.

"Oil prices fell on Tuesday after the U.S. government said it would release more crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, lifting some supply concerns from the market.Brent futures for April delivery fell $1.22, or 1.4%, to $85.39 a barrel by 11:17 a.m. EST (1617 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for March fell by $1.32, or 1.7%, to $78.82 a barrel.Both benchmarks were down by more than $2 a barrel earlier in the session, but pared some losses after data showed the U.S consumer price index accelerated at its slowest annual pace since late 2021, raising the likelihood of less aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.“The financial markets are still trying to digest the CPI report, with rate hike expectations moving up and down and influencing asset classes such as oil,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.“With U.S. equity markets moving up, oil is paring some of its earlier losses,” he said.On Monday, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said it would sell 26 million barrels of oil from the SPR, which is already at its lowest level since 1983.The DOE had considered cancelling the sale after U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration last year sold a record 180 million barrels from the reserve. But that would have required Congress to act to change the mandate.Supply concerns also eased after the Energy Information Administration said it expected record March production from the seven biggest U.S. shale basins.Elsewhere, crude exports resumed at a key Turkish port after a devastating earthquake rocked the region earlier this month.In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised its 2023 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day, citing the reopening of the Chinese economy after COVID restrictions.A monthly report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is due on Wednesday.

"The value of Singapore’s oil trade in 2022 climbed by 47.5% from a year earlier, extending a 43.6% increase in 2021, driven mainly by rising domestic exports and re-exports of refined products, government agency Enterprise Singapore said.The rise in the oil trade value came in a year when global oil prices rallied after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reshaped energy markets and oil majors reaped bumper profits.Singapore’s domestic exports of oil last year firmed by 52.4% in nominal terms, extending gains from a 38% growth in 2021, data from Enterprise Singapore showed.The growth in oil domestic exports was led by an uptick in the value of oil shipments to popular blending hub Malaysia, which surged by 66.1% year-on-year.Other top destinations for domestic exports from Singapore were Indonesia and Australia, which saw the value of exports rising by 66.5% and 53% respectively, the data showed.In volume terms, exports last year rose by 1.7% from 2021, when volumes fell by 10.1% from a year earlier.Oil re-exports from Singapore also rose from the previous year in nominal terms, climbing by 28.1% year-on-year in 2022 and extending from 19.1% growth in 2021.The gain was led by a rise in the value of re-exports to countries within Asia, including Bangladesh at 358.8%, Myanmar at 184.4% and Taiwan at 252.9%.However, on a volume basis, oil re-exports fell last year by 5.4% from 2021, when they contracted by 26.2% from a year earlier.
Singapore’s total 2022 merchandise trade was supported by the growth in oil trade, though lower expected oil prices could weigh on oil trade in 2023 and in turn weigh on total merchandise trade this year, Enterprise Singapore said.Global oil prices have eased from multi-year highs reached in 2022, as recessionary fears and volatile demand recovery weighed on sentiment in 2023.

"The five largest Western oil firms announced nearly $200 billion in profits after the Ukraine war sent energy prices soaring. Strong Chinese oil demand could mean more huge payouts alongside calls for windfall taxes.Financial markets were stunned in April 2020 when the price of oil turned negative for the first time ever. As demand plummeted during the first COVID lockdown, the main US oil benchmark price fell to minus $30 (minus €28) a barrel.Naysayers said prices would never recover. They warned that big oil’s days were numbered and the end of the hydrocarbon era was nigh. While they are correct about the direction of travel, their timing was way off.The same five Western oil giants — ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total — who made huge losses in 2020, have just collectively announced more than $196 billion in annual profits, helped on by a spike in oil demand caused by the Ukraine war and the post-pandemic recovery.For much of the first half of last year, the oil price surpassed $100 and in March, Brent crude hit $139 a barrel. For the remainder of the year, it settled between $70 and $95 — much higher than the $40 to $50 needed for oil majors to make profits.Exxon’s profit in 2022 was a record not just for itself but for any US or European oil giant. BP’s $28 billion profit was the highest in its 114-year history, while Shell made more than double the profit it made in the previous year.As well as soaring oil prices, falling debt levels helped the oil majors to increase capital spending on fossil fuel production as governments prioritized energy security due to the supply shock caused by Western sanctions on Moscow and the Kremlin’s inconsistent energy supplies to Europe after the invasion of Ukraine.BP CEO Bernard Looney was denounced by the green lobby when he said he wanted to “dial back” some of the energy giant’s investments in renewable energies due to the risk of oil and gas supply shortages causing more price volatility.Contempt for ‘dirty’ cash cows
Public anger at Big Oil’s announcements of record profits is visceral, not only due to the urgent green energy push.Over the last year, households and businesses have been hit hard by skyrocketing utility bills and the price of gasoline. While many governments have tried to limit the damage with subsidies, many see Big Oil as profiteering from public misery, so calls for windfall taxes on profits are growing louder.The UK and the European Union have already imposed temporary levies on oil and gas sector profits. Politicians and unions have called for those to be increased. In their results updates, Shell, Total and BP revealed that the new taxes would cost them each about $2 billion — about 5% to 8% of profits.ExxonMobil, meanwhile, is suing the EU to get the bloc to scrap its new windfall tax. The US’s largest oil firm argues that Brussels has exceeded its authority by imposing the levy, which it says is normally a role for national governments.Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said in December that the tax would “undermine investor confidence, discourage investment and increase reliance on imported energy.”Biden urges tax hikes for oil majors
US President Joe Biden used his State of the Union address this week to call for energy giants to be squeezed further, demanding a quadrupling of taxes paid on share buybacks.“When I talked to a couple of [energy companies], they said, ‘We are afraid you are going to shut down all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?’ We are going to need oil for at least another decade,” Biden told Congress. “Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing.”The top Western oil companies paid out a record $110 billion in dividends and share repurchases to investors in 2022, according to a tally by Reuters news agency.Oil giants have slashed their longer-term investments in recent years, partly after the US shale oil bust of the last decade but also after nursing heavy pandemic losses. With an ever-uncertain future due to the green energy transition, reticence remains over major capital spending.China reopening to fuel demand
More pain could be on the way for consumers and businesses as China reopens after a 3-year zero-COVID policy, further fueling demand for oil while boosting Big Oil’s profits further still.Although oil prices are not expected to reach their July 2008 all-time high of $150 a barrel anytime soon, some analysts predict the price could reach $100 again later this year — before a recession or downturn hits major economies and stalls demand.In its latest oil market forecast published Tuesday, the Oxford Energy Institute said that oil prices would reach $95.7 a barrel, partly as a result of demand from Asia’s powerhouse economy. Goldman Sachs sees prices returning to $100 by December.Russia said this week it planned to cut production by half a million barrels a day from next month, a move that sent prices higher. Moscow blamed the move on Western oil sanctions, including a European Union price cap of $60 on Russian crude oil. The Kremlin has so far diverted the oil it used to send to Europe to China and India, albeit at a 30% discount.A further sign of strong oil demand came this week from Barclays Capital which forecast even higher profits for the oil majors. It set a share price target of 10 pounds ($12, €11.29) for BP, a near doubling from its Friday price of 5.61 pounds.

"The Biden administration said on Monday it is selling 26 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a release that had been mandated by Congress in previous years.The U.S. Department of Energy had considered cancelling the fiscal year 2023 sale of the 26 million barrels after the Biden administration last year sold a record 180 million barrels from the reserve. But such a cancellation would have required Congress to act.Monday’s announced sale will likely temporarily push the reserve below its current level of about 372 million barrels, its lowest level since 1983.The DOE said bids on the oil are due on Feb. 28 and that the oil would be delivered from April 1 to June 30.The administration sold the 180 million barrels of oil to combat fuel prices that had risen on Russia’s war on Ukraine and as global consumers emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.The department said it is implementing a three-part strategy to refill the reserve in the long term, including repurchases with revenues from emergency sales, returns of more than 25 million barrels of oil from previous exchanges, and working with Congress to avoid “unnecessary sales unrelated to supply disruptions to strategically maintain volume.The DOE said it expects that companies will return 3.1 million barrels of oil to the SPR this fiscal year and 22 million barrels in fiscal year 2024 from exchanges, or short term loans of oil conducted to help deal with supply concerns in the wake of hurricanes.Last year, Congress canceled sales of about 140 million barrels from the SPR that had been set to take place from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2027, after a DOE proposal to stop them.

Higher inflation and ensuing rate hikes may weigh on risk assets such as oil.“The upcoming data tsunami will greatly influence the immediate risk appetite, but the broader view has not changed: inflation will ultimately be defeated,” said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.“The second half of the year should bring with it tight oil balance greatly aided by reviving Chinese growth.”

"Oil may resume its rally in 2023 as Chinese demand recovers after COVID curbs were scrapped and lack of investment limits growth in supply, OPEC country officials told Reuters, with a growing number seeing a possible return to $100 a barrel.In 2022, oil soared above $100 for the first time since 2014 as demand recovered from COVID-19 lockdowns in much of the world and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added to supply concerns. But Brent crude ended the year close to $86 on fears of global recession.A move back above $100 for a prolonged period would earn more revenue for OPEC members, whose economies mostly depend on oil income, and be a setback for industrialised economies trying to control inflation and interest rates.To support the market, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, in October agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels per day, about 2% of world demand.After 2022’s volatility, which sent Brent crude LCOc1 close to its all-time high of $147 soon after the Ukraine war began, so far in 2023 Brent is up slightly at just over $86, helped by Russia’s plan to cut output in March.OPEC and OPEC+ do not publish oil price forecasts and do not have a price target. Officials and ministers from OPEC and OPEC+, are often reluctant to discuss the direction of prices on the record.In rare public comments on Feb. 8, Iran’s national representative to OPEC, Afshin Javan, said oil may rebound to around $100 in the second half of the year, adding that OPEC+ was likely to keep its current output policy at its next meeting.Reuters spoke privately to five more OPEC country officials about the prospect of $100 oil. Of these, three saw oil as more likely to rally in 2023 than decline, with two predicting prices heading back to $100.“It should be said that the shadow of the energy crisis will continue to dominate the world and the general trend of global oil prices will increase,” said one of the OPEC sources.“In my opinion, the return of Brent crude to above $100 at some time in 2023 is not unexpected.”Consensus in the industry currently is for lower prices in 2022. A Reuters survey of 30 economists and analysts forecast Brent would average $89.37 a barrel in 2023, down from $99 in 2022. Goldman Sachs lowered its 2023 Brent forecast to $92.The sudden lifting of China’s COVID restrictions is likely to boost oil demand growth in 2023, after the country was estimated to have posted a small decline in 2022 for the first time in years.OPEC sources also see a lack of investment to increase supply supporting prices. OPEC members are pumping almost 1 million bpd less than their target, according to the group’s own figures and other estimates.While non-OPEC producers are still expected to pump more in 2023, the forecast of an increase of 1.5 million bpd falls short of expected demand growth of 2.2 million bpd, according to OPEC forecasts.“Even with the additional supplies coming from here and there, still the market will witness a lack of supply compared to the demand,” another OPEC source said. “There is more upward than downward pressure on the market.”NO ACTION OVER RUSSIAThe OPEC+ cut agreed in October applies for the whole of 2023. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, on Feb. 5 urged producers to reconsider their output policies “if demand goes up very strongly.”So far they have no plan to change direction. Key OPEC+ ministers at a Feb. 1 meeting endorsed the existing policy, after which a source said the key message was OPEC+ is staying the course until the end of the deal.Two OPEC+ delegates told Reuters on Friday that OPEC+ plans no action after Russia announced output cuts.Another OPEC source agreed that prices may head back to $100 in 2023, although the prospects for economic growth were the main risk.“Everything will depend on the economy – if there is improvement in China of course, we will maybe arrive back to$100,” he said. A crude price between $85 and $100 is “good for everybody,” he added.The IEA, which represents 31 countries including top consumer the United States, did not immediately reply on Friday to a request for comment on what $100 oil would mean for its members. In November, Birol said $100 oil was a real risk for the global economy.As well as recession risks, those OPEC sources who envisage lower prices in 2023 said it was unclear how much demand would come from China and whether it would impose lockdowns again to contain COVID flareups.“There are still uncertainties about economic growth, inflation and China’s reopening,” said the second OPEC source who sees lower prices this year.

"OPEC expects global oil demand to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2023, amid an improving economic outlook in top crude importer China, Haitham Al Ghais, the group’s secretary general, said on Sunday.Mr Ghais, who was speaking at the Egypt Petroleum Show in Cairo, also said an investment of $12.1 trillion is required until 2045 to ensure stability in global energy markets.Oil demand is expected to reach record levels this year after China, the world’s second-largest economy, lifted pandemic curbs following strict adherence to a zero-Covid policy for nearly three years.China is forecast to expand 5.2 per cent this year after beating expectations with a 3 per cent acceleration in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund.Brent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world’s oil, surged to $90 a barrel last month on hopes of a swift fuel demand rebound in China. However, rising oil stocks in the US and expectations of further interest rate increases have weighed on crude futures in recent weeks.Brent, which soared to nearly $140 a barrel following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, closed trading on Friday at $86.39.The International Energy Agency has said China will account for nearly half of its 2023 oil demand growth forecast of 1.9 million barrels per day.China’s recovery and sanctions on Russian oil exports are expected to tighten global crude supplies in the second half of the year, analysts said.At its meeting this month, the Opec+ alliance of 23 oil-producing countries agreed to roll over existing output cuts of 2 million bpd.A 1.1 million bpd rise in China demand this year could push oil markets back into a supply deficit in June and lead Opec+ to reverse its production cuts, Goldman Sachs said in a research note last week.“If Russia production were to stay flat, then Brent would likely only rise to $95 per barrel by December because steady Opec production would only partly undo the bearish effects from higher supply and less elevated long-term costs,” Goldman Sachs said.

"The latest forecast for the crude oil price level during the coming months is $140. The main reason behind this price level is the strong recovery of China’s economy with the anticipation that it could push its demand for oil to almost four million barrels from one million barrels last year. The announcement made by Russia to reduce its production by 500,000 barrels with immediate effect pushed the oil price to $87 a barrel in no time.However, there is no news to ascertain whether the Russian reduction was done in coordination with its peer group of oil producers – OPEC+ – or whether it has done this solely without any consultation. Under the current scenario with the European Union’s boycott of Russian oil and gas, Russia is losing its revenues. Also, it is spending much of its cash resources on its war and occupation of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the G7 is imposing severe restrictions on Russian oil at its own price rules such as $60 per barrel for Russian oil sales, along with marine and insurance restrictions. The other fact is that Russia is losing its energy market in the European Union forever without any return to this huge market that has been under its dominance for years and years. Russia also must invest in a new gas pipeline to export its gas to China in the coming ten years.In our opinion, Russia has lost its secured market outputs forever, with the gas prices coming down. Strangely enough, Europe managed to secure all its requirements within a short time, while Russia remained with a huge deficit of $25 billion in its budget due to the 47 percent drop in the energy income. The drop and reduction of 500, 000 barrels certainly will lead to some hardening of oil prices at a time when the oil supply is tight and the demand is on the rise. The recovery of China’s economy will surely lead to a shortage of oil.The most likely scenario could be that other oil producers may try to exchange and buy Russian crude oils at much lower prices. If the reduction prevails, then we should anticipate higher oil prices. Oil price may not hit the forecasted level of $140, but due to the current situation with Russia pushing for more oil reduction and with the OPEC+ being firm to not push for more increase, oil prices will hit $100 per barrel, but anything above that may not be sustainable.

"The United Arab Emirates energy minister on Monday said he sees no need for an earlier than scheduled meeting of the OPEC+ group of producers.“I do not see a requirement for a meeting. The market is balanced,” Suhail al-Mazrouei said when asked whether the alliance would meet earlier than scheduled after Russia announced unilateral cuts.Russia said on Friday it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) next month after the West imposed price caps on Russian oil and oil products.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, agreed in October to cut oil production targets by 2 million bpd until the end of 2023.Mazrouei said that the agreement was long term for a reason and that they would only consider altering it if the group saw something “that would shake the market”.“We haven’t seen that. The market is balanced and stable,” he added.An OPEC+ ministerial committee is set to meet in early April with a full ministerial meeting planned for June 4.

"The big oil companies – from the UK-based BP and Shell to international giants such as ExxonMobil and Norway’s Equinor – have been announcing astonishing profit figures.They are all benefitting from the surging price of oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine.While they rake in the profits, people around the world are struggling to pay their energy bills and fill up their cars – leading to calls for higher taxes on these companies.So how are they making so much money, and should the government step in to stop them?Why has the oil price soared?Oil and gas are traded around the world, and if supplies are short and demand high, sellers can charge more, and the price goes up.Before the Ukraine war, Russia was the world’s largest exporter of oil and natural gas.A lot of the money that people paid to buy that oil and gas went to the Russian government – those exports made up 45% of the Russian government budget in 2021.After the invasion, Western countries, including the UK and EU, tried to stop (or at least massively reduce) their energy imports from Russia, to avoid funding the Russian military and supporting a hostile regime.Countries that didn’t want to buy from Russia had to pay much higher prices for oil produced elsewhere.Oil prices had already been rising as economies reopened following Covid-19 lockdowns, and people needed more oil.The day after the Russian invasion, the oil price went above $100 a barrel, and peaked at over $127 in March, before coming back down to around $85. Gas prices also soared after the invasion.Oil and natural gas are crucial to almost every aspect of modern life. Oil is used to make petrol and diesel, and natural gas is used for heating and cooking.They’re also used in agriculture, electricity generation, and other industrial processes which make everything from fertilizer to plastics.So a sustained rise in oil and gas prices pushes up the cost of many other things we buy, driving the cost of living crisis that has gripped the UK – and other countries – in recent months.Why do soaring prices mean more profits?Oil companies make money by locating oil and gas reserves buried in rocks under the earth’s surface, and drilling down to release them.The costs don’t vary that much as the price goes up or down, but the money they make from selling it does.So when oil prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine, the money these companies made from selling oil and gas massively increased as well.How much profit did Shell and BP make last year?On Tuesday, BP reported record annual profits of $27.7bn (£23bn) for 2022, as it scaled back plans to reduce the amount of oil and gas it produces by 2030. Those profits were double the previous year’s figure.In February, Shell reported its highest profits in 115 years. Profits hit $39.9bn (£32.2bn) in 2022, double the previous year’s total.The profits they make don’t all disappear – lots of ordinary people own shares in BP, Shell, and other global oil companies. This may be via their pension funds, and they may not even be aware of it.Some of the extra profits are paid to shareholders through higher dividends, and buying back shares (which increases the share price).But as long as the billions roll in while customers struggle to pay their bills, the calls for higher taxes will continue.How much tax do oil and gas producers pay?Big oil companies made their record profits even after paying billions to governments around the world.BP and Shell are in a complicated position because they are headquartered in the UK but produce a relatively small amount of oil and gas in UK waters. They make most of their profits from activities around the world.Shell paid $134m (£110m) tax on its UK operations in 2022, out of a worldwide tax bill of $13bn.BP paid $2.2bn (£1.8bn) in taxes on its UK operations, out of a global tax bill of $15bn.How are oil firms taxed in the UK?Oil companies already pay a tax on their profits from oil and gas production in the UK of 40% – which is higher than taxes on other companies.But they can reduce that tax bill by deducting the cost of shutting down old oil rigs, or offsetting future investments and losses from earlier years.In some years, BP and Shell have paid no tax on UK operations, and received payments from the UK government instead.After the invasion of Ukraine, the government faced calls to introduce an extra “windfall tax” on energy company profits to help pay for soaring energy bills.This was introduced in May 2022, and increased from 25% to 35% in November. It is now expected to raise around £40bn extra from all the companies operating in UK waters between 2022 and 2028.However, the windfall tax only applies to the profits on UK oil and gas production, which only account for a small share of some firms’ profits.And firms can deduct more than 90% of the cost of new exploration and production from their windfall tax bills, significantly reducing what they have to pay.The windfall tax accounted for all of Shell’s UK tax bill, and $700m (£538m) of BP’s.They face calls to pay even more taxPoliticians, environmentalists, trade unions and poverty campaigners have attacked oil companies’ record profits, and argued for higher windfall taxes.They say high prices are the result of something beyond the oil firm’s control – war, and that it’s not fair that oil companies are profiting from people’s suffering.Some say higher windfall taxes are a good way for governments to raise money because they’re easy to collect and hard to avoid.Even the former boss of Shell himself, Ben van Beurden, wondered if it was inevitable that governments would need to tax energy producers more to protect the poorest in society.But oil firms argue that a higher windfall tax would make them less willing to invest in producing in the UK, and that they would search for oil elsewhere where taxes are lower.Harbour Energy, which produces more oil and gas in the UK than anyone else, is cutting jobs and reconsidering its UK investments because of the windfall tax.
If the UK government decided to tax BP and Shell on their global profits more heavily, they could potentially move their headquarters out of the country – escaping the new tax, and depriving the UK of much of the revenues they currently pay.Oil companies have to operate in a world where the price of oil can go down as well as up, with little warning. Money made in the good years helps to balance out years when oil prices are low.Many oil companies lost billions from Russian investments last year – BP wrote off $24bn of investments in the Russian oil company Rosneft, for example.They also have to invest billions to find new reserves of oil to keep supplies running until the world switches over to renewable sources of power.Energy companies have a big role to play in that switch-over, too. BP and Shell invest some of the billions they make from oil and gas into renewable power such as solar and wind farms, and charging stations for electric cars.BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was “helping provide the energy the world needs” while investing the transition to green energy.Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said that these are “incredibly difficult times – we are seeing inflation rampant around the world” but that Shell was playing its part by investing in renewable technologies. Its chief financial officer Sinead Gorman added that Shell had paid $13bn in taxes globally in 2022.However, BP scaled back its plans to cut its carbon emissions this year because demand for oil and gas is so strong.Does the energy cap reduce oil company profits?The energy price cap was introduced in 2019 to stop companies overcharging people who didn’t shop around for cheaper deals. It targets energy suppliers, and doesn’t affect the profits of oil and gas producers.

"The OPEC+ coalition increased its crude oil production by 40,000 b/d in January, the latest Platts survey by S&P Global Commodity Insights found, as Russian production remained relatively resilient to the impact of sanctions.Russia’s volumes fell just 10,000 b/d in the month to average 9.85 million b/d, according to the survey, despite an EU embargo on imports of Russian crude and an accompanying G7 price cap that went into force Dec. 5.Elsewhere, Nigeria and Congo-Brazzaville showed healthy recoveries, offsetting declines in Saudi Arabia and neighboring Bahrain.OPEC’s 13 members pumped 29.09 million b/d in January, up 110,000 b/d from December, the survey found, while the bloc’s nine allies led by Russia produced 13.66 million b/d, down 70,000 b/d.While Russia has managed to maintain robust crude production through the ratcheting sanctions imposed by western countries over its invasion of Ukraine, analysts expect the latest measures to levy a substantive impact.From Feb. 5, the EU began banning imports of Russian refined products in addition to crude oil, with the G7 adding a price cap to those fuels as well.S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that Russian supply disruptions will peak at 700,000 b/d below pre-war levels in March, as refineries are forced to cut runs and storage facilities reach capacity. That is, however, down from a December forecast of 900,000 b/d in disruptions, as the market has found ways to sustain flows of Russian crude so far.An escalation in the conflict in Ukraine and the introduction of additional sanctions could see these estimates increase, however.Prices for Russia’s key crude grade Urals continue to trade at massive discounts. Platts, a part of S&P Global, assessed Urals at $44.82/b, compared to Dated Brent at $83.15/b on Feb. 8.Under targetsGrowing Nigerian production underpinned the increase in OPEC output in January.Nigeria pumped 1.40 million b/d in January, the survey found, up 70,000 b/d from December and the highest since April, as key grade Agbami returned from maintenance and recently troubled flows of Forcados and Bonga saw continued rebounds.Congo was also a big gainer in January, with a major field returning from maintenance.OPEC’s biggest producer Saudi Arabia produced 10.42 million b/d in January, down 60,000 b/d, as exports showed a sizeable fall, the survey found.
Bahrain also posted a decline, as the Gulf producer saw its output fall to 150,000 b/d from 200,000 b/d.With several countries still struggling to raise or even maintain output due to internal disruptions or lack of investment, the OPEC+ alliance continues to massively underproduce its quotas, even with the group agreeing to slash them by 2 million b/d from November through the end of 2023.Overall OPEC+ compliance among countries with quotas was 149.41% in January, according to S&P Global calculations, with a combined 1.79 million b/d shortfall to their production targets.OPEC members Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from quotas.An OPEC+ monitoring committee co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and Russia announced Feb. 1 that it would recommend no change to quotas.The monitoring committee is next due to meet April 3, followed by a full OPEC+ ministerial meeting scheduled for June 4.The Platts survey figures measure wellhead production, and are compiled using information from oil industry officials, traders, and analysts, as well as reviewing proprietary shipping, satellite, and inventory data.

"Oil prices edged higher on Monday, rebounding from early losses as investors weighed Russia plans to cut crude production and short-term demand concerns ahead of U.S. inflation data.Brent futures for April delivery rose 30 cents, or 0.4%, to $86.69 a barrel, by 12:35 p.m. ET (17:35 GMT). U.S. crude rose 58 cents, or 0.7%, to $80.30 per barrel gain.“The fundamental backdrop for oil is still very strong,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.“With China reopening, we will see more demand and Russia and OPEC has the same or less supply, which is bullish.”Oil prices had risen on Friday to its highest in two weeks after Russia, the world’s third-largest oil producer, said it would cut crude production in March by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about 5% of output, in retaliation against Western curbs imposed on its exports in response to the Ukraine conflict.Both the Brent and WTI contracts rose more than 8% last week, buoyed by optimism over demand recovery in China after COVID curbs were scrapped in December.The U.S. Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to rein in inflation, leading to concerns the move would slow economic activity and demand for oil.“It is difficult to overstate the importance of this single data point, as traders and the Fed look for confirmation of the gradual downward trend of the past few months,” said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury.Additionally, supply concerns were relieved somewhat as a cargo of Azeri crude set sail from Turkey’s Ceyhan port on Monday, the first since a devastating earthquake in the region on Feb. 6.Ceyhan is the storage and loading point for pipelines that carry oil from Azerbaijan and Iraq.

"US residual fuel oil inventories have averaged 7% higher so far this month than in January and continue to linger close to multi-month high levels, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows.Changes in monthly average US residual fuel oil from January to February (so far):Total US fuel oil stock levels have grown this month, partly as less fuel oil has been supplied out of storage to outlets like bunker fuel blenders and bulk terminals, to refinery coking units for upgrades to other higher-value products, or to power generation. Supply, or implied demand, has declined to its lowest level in six weeks.US fuel oil production has declined by 8% on the month. East Coast refineries have produced 34% less fuel oil so far this month, followed by 24% less from Gulf Coast refineries and 9% less from West Coast refineries.Overall US refinery utilisation has averaged about 88% this month, up from 85% in January. But utilisation is still down from highs of 90% in December and 94% in November.Maintenances at several US refineries have contributed to cap refinery utilisation. “We forecast domestic refinery maintenance will contribute to reduced refinery utilization in the US through April,” the EIA wrote in a short-term energy outlook this week.Many US refineries postponed their planned turnarounds last year as low inventory levels and attractive refining margins encouraged them to maximise utilisation. “Although current refining margins remain above normal levels, we expect more refiners will undergo deferred maintenance this season,” the EIA said.US fuel oil imports have remained roughly steady between January and this month. According to cargo tracker Vortexa, about 81% of US fuel oil imports have arrived on the Gulf Coast, followed by 13% on the West Coast and the remaining 6% on the East Coast.Changes in monthly US residual fuel oil from January to February (so far):Mexico has been the US’ biggest fuel oil import source this month, a position it has been holding since April last year, when direct Russian imports were fully phased out with an embargo. Fuel oil imports from Mexico have accounted for 32% this month, down from 52% in January.Iraq has replaced the Bahamas to emerge as the US’ second biggest fuel oil source this month.The EIA’s fuel oil export figures lag two months behind figures for imports and other data. Going by Vortexa data, US fuel oil exports started dipping from January and into this month.More than two-thirds of US fuel oil exports have departed for the Caribbean region this month, including the US Virgin Islands, Honduras and Curacao.

"East Texas gas traders continued to balk at the prospect of a quick restart of the Freeport LNG export terminal after an eight-month long outage, even as the exporter’s return-to-service activities progressed with the approval of US energy regulators to resume ship loading and the Feb. 10 arrival of a tanker at the Texas facility.The Feb. 9 sign-off from the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to resume ship loading marked another step forward for the operator as it prepares to seek authorization to resume commercial operations from one of the 15 million mt/year capacity export terminal’s three liquefaction trains, which have been offline since June 8, 2022.But significant uncertainty remained in the market about the timeline for the return of feedgas demand at Freeport, which can take up to 2.1 Bcf/d when it is operating fully and could help reduce a supply overhang weighing on domestic gas prices. The BP-charted Kmarin Diamond tanker moored at the facility on Feb. 10 was the first vessel to dock at the export terminal since the outage, although a market source said it was being loaded with inventory produced before the shutdown.Feedgas flows to the Freeport terminal remained small Feb. 10, and the recent commissioning developments did little to offset gas futures traders’ reaction to a host of other bearish supply-demand factors, including muted US heating demand this winter, a rising storage surplus and a mild temperature forecast for the balance of February.“The Freeport LNG facility remains one positive piece of news that could help with a restart potentially occurring in March,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold said in a recent note to clients.As it stands, natural gas prices are “desperately seeking the bottom,” said Phil Flynn, senior account executive at Price Futures Group, in a Feb. 10 report.“Reports that the Freeport LNG terminal is giving permission to resume some ship loading may be a reason for optimism, but a reason for pessimism is weather should be above normal,” Flynn said.Market sources have been expecting Freeport’s first export since the outage at the terminal to happen in the second half of February. Freeport, which declined to comment, has reported completing the necessary repair and operational improvements required for restart. But spot US gas prices have responded tepidly to the slight uptick in East Texas gas demand over the past week.Freeport was scheduled to receive nearly 136 MMcf/d of feedgas on Feb. 10, based on nominations for the morning cycle that could later be revised, S&P Global Commodity Insights data showed. Overall US LNG feedgas demand was about 12.7 Bcf/d.Over the past several months, the forward market at Houston Ship Channel has priced in steep basis discounts at the East Texas hub for March, April and May 2023, likely reflecting doubts over the resumption of LNG feedgas demand at the Freeport terminal. In late December 2022, prices for all three contracts cratered after the Quintana Island terminal operator acknowledged in a press release that the facility’s restart would again be delayed to second-half January.While the March, April and May forward basis discounts have since narrowed, the three contract prices have all but converged recently to trade around 30 cents behind Henry Hub. The June and July forward basis discounts at Houston Ship Channel, meanwhile, have been hardly affected by the on-again, off-again restart news at Freeport.Perhaps more telling, is that the July forward basis spread is significantly narrower compared with the earlier contracts – currently trading at just 14 cents behind Henry Hub – likely signaling the market’s confidence that feedgas demand at Freeport LNG will have resumed by mid-summer.Analysts at Mizuho Securities said in a recent note to clients that “Freeport’s intentions have largely lost the confidence of the market,” with traders instead waiting on FERC authorization for the exporter to resume operations.For the global LNG market, Freeport’s expected near-term resumption of shipments has continued to help drive bearish price sentiment. LNG prices have fallen significantly from 2022 levels but remain high relative to historical norms.The Platts Gulf Coast Marker for US FOB cargoes loading 30-60 days forward was assessed at $13.385/MMBtu Feb. 10, up 13.5 cents/MMBtu day on day.
